# BootChamp is not compatible with El Capitan and has been [discontinued](http://kainjow.tumblr.com/post/128933657269/bootchamp-and-el-capitan).

BootChamp is an OS X menu bar app that makes it easy to boot into your Boot Camp Windows partition. Instead of using Startup Disk in System Preferences or holding down the Option key at startup, just select "Restart into Windows" and BootChamp will do the rest.
